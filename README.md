# population-growth-simulator
A simple program to show population decline over time at given birth rates. Uses simulation logic to provide a more scalable complexity than calculus based alternatives.

use cases:

1.0: User inputs population distribution, average age of mortality, fertility rate and simulation length and system returns a table showing the population size over that time,
also determines half life if the population is halved in the given time frame.

2.0: User can use the user interface to input parameters and view output instead of console

3.0: User can designate multiple demographic groups to track changes over time

4.0: Users can input increases or decreases to fertility rate in terms of trends or in sudden increases for ranges or specific years in the timeline. Useful for modelling government intervention efforts quickly given assumed impacts.

5.0: Graphical representation of data allows for quick and understandability of data. Useful for practical applications.
